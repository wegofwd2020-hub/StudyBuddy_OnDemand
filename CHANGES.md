# StudyBuddy OnDemand — Implementation Log

## Implementation Log

### Phase D — Curriculum Builder: definition form + approval queue (2026-04-12)

**Branch:** `feat/phase-d-curriculum-builder`  
**Design docs:** `docs/REGISTRATION_DESIGN_ANALYSIS.md` (Q7, Q9, Q18 — form UI, school admin approval)

**What ships:**

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| **Migration 0039** | `curriculum_definitions` table with RLS tenant isolation. Status enum: `pending_approval` / `approved` / `rejected`. Stores subjects as JSONB: `[{subject_label, units:[{title}]}]` |
| **Backend schemas** | `DefinitionUnitEntry`, `DefinitionSubjectEntry`, `CurriculumDefinitionRequest` (validates grade 1–12, languages in {en,fr,es}, at-least-one subject/unit), `CurriculumDefinitionResponse`, `DefinitionListResponse`, `RejectDefinitionRequest` |
| **Backend service** | `submit_definition`, `list_definitions` (admin sees all; teacher sees own; optional status filter), `get_definition`, `approve_definition` (UPDATE WHERE status='pending_approval'), `reject_definition` |
| **Backend router** | 5 new endpoints: `POST /definitions`, `GET /definitions`, `GET /definitions/{id}`, `POST /definitions/{id}/approve`, `POST /definitions/{id}/reject` |
| **school-admin.ts** | `listDefinitions`, `getDefinition`, `submitDefinition`, `approveDefinition`, `rejectDefinition`; TypeScript interfaces `CurriculumDefinition`, `DefinitionSubject`, `DefinitionUnit` |
| **Curriculum page** | Definitions panel link inserted above tab switcher |
| **Definitions list page** | `/school/curriculum/definitions` — status tabs (Pending/Approved/Rejected/All); inline approve + reject-with-reason; link to detail |
| **Definition builder (new)** | `/school/curriculum/definitions/new` — 4-step form: (1) name+grade, (2) subjects+units (add/remove, per-subject unit list), (3) languages toggle, (4) review+submit |
| **Definition detail page** | `/school/curriculum/definitions/[id]` — subject/unit list; admin review card (approve/reject inline); approved state shows next-step hint |
| **Tests** | 19 tests in `test_phase_d_definitions.py` — all passing |

**Design decisions:**
- `approve_definition` and `reject_definition` use `UPDATE WHERE status = 'pending_approval'` — acting on an already-decided definition returns 409
- Teacher can only view their own definitions; admin can see all (list + detail)
- Rejection reason stored in DB and surfaced to teacher in list and detail views
- Phase E pipeline trigger is gated on `status = 'approved'` — not yet wired (Phase E)

**Test count:** 724 passed, 6 skipped (full suite)

---

### Phase C — Curriculum Catalog: browse platform packages (2026-04-12)

**Branch:** `feat/phase-c-curriculum-catalog`  
**Design docs:** `docs/REGISTRATION_DESIGN_ANALYSIS.md` (Q12, Q13)

**What ships:**

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| **Backend schemas** | `CatalogSubjectSummary`, `CatalogEntry`, `CatalogResponse` in `school/schemas.py` |
| **Backend service** | `list_catalog(conn, grade?)` — queries platform curricula with subject/unit counts and content readiness via lateral join on `curriculum_units` and `content_subject_versions` |
| **Backend router** | `GET /api/v1/curricula/catalog` with optional `?grade=N` filter; accessible to any authenticated teacher or school_admin |
| **school-admin.ts** | `getCatalog(grade?)` function; `CatalogEntry`, `CatalogSubjectSummary`, `CatalogResponse` TypeScript interfaces |
| **SchoolNav** | Added "Catalog" nav item (`LayoutGrid` icon) between Curriculum and Content Library |
| **Catalog browser page** | `/school/catalog` — grade filter dropdown; package cards with expandable subject list; content readiness bar (approved subjects / total); legend |
| **Tests** | 6 tests in `tests/test_phase_c_catalog.py` — all passing |

**Design decisions:**
- Catalog is read-only; assignment to classroom happens from the classroom detail page (Phase B)
- Content readiness = `content_subject_versions.status IN ('approved', 'published')` per subject
- No FK from `classroom_packages.curriculum_id` — catalog IDs are TEXT, platform packages may not be in test DB
- `owner_type = 'platform'` is the filter for catalog; RLS on `curricula` already exposes these rows to all authenticated users

**Test count:** 705 passed, 6 skipped (full suite)

---

### Phase B — Classrooms: entity, CRUD, package + student assignment (2026-04-12)

**Branch:** `feat/phase-b-classroom`  
**Design docs:** `docs/REGISTRATION_DESIGN_ANALYSIS.md` (Q14, Q16, Q17, Q22), `docs/REGISTRATION_DESIGN_QA.md`

**What ships:**

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| **Migration 0038** | `classrooms`, `classroom_packages`, `classroom_students` tables with RLS tenant isolation. `classroom_packages.curriculum_id` is TEXT (no FK — matches `curricula.curriculum_id TEXT PK`; platform IDs like "default-2026-g8" don't need a DB row) |
| **Backend schemas** | `ClassroomCreateRequest`, `ClassroomUpdateRequest`, `ClassroomItem`, `ClassroomDetailResponse`, `ClassroomPackageItem`, `ClassroomStudentItem`, `AssignPackageRequest`, `ReorderPackageRequest`, `AssignStudentRequest` |
| **Backend service** | `create_classroom`, `list_classrooms`, `get_classroom_detail`, `update_classroom`, `assign_package_to_classroom`, `remove_package_from_classroom`, `reorder_package_in_classroom`, `assign_student_to_classroom`, `remove_student_from_classroom` |
| **Backend router** | 9 new endpoints on `/schools/{id}/classrooms/…` — create, list, detail, update (PATCH), assign/reorder/remove package, assign/remove student |
| **school-admin.ts** | `listClassrooms`, `getClassroom`, `createClassroom`, `updateClassroom`, `assignPackageToClassroom`, `reorderPackageInClassroom`, `removePackageFromClassroom`, `assignStudentToClassroom`, `removeStudentFromClassroom` with TypeScript interfaces |
| **SchoolNav** | Added "Classrooms" nav item (`DoorOpen` icon) above "Class Overview" |
| **Classrooms list page** | `/school/classrooms` — active/archived classroom cards with student/package counts; create form (admin-only); archive/restore toggle |
| **Classroom detail page** | `/school/classrooms/[classroomId]` — package list + add-by-ID form; student roster + enrol-by-ID form; inline remove with confirmation |
| **Tests** | 21 tests in `tests/test_phase_b_classrooms.py` — all passing |

**Design decisions:**
- A student may be in multiple classrooms simultaneously (Q17 — temporal reassignment)
- `classroom_packages.curriculum_id` has no FK; application logic gates assignment
- Archive/restore via `PATCH status` rather than DELETE — preserves history
- Duplicate unit_id across packages: both shown (Q22) — no merging
- Curriculum ID input is UUID/text string for now; catalog browser is Phase C

**Design docs committed:**
- `docs/REGISTRATION_DESIGN_ANALYSIS.md` — full Q&A to decisions mapping
- `docs/REGISTRATION_DESIGN_QA.md` — original Q&A with answers
- `docs/DESIGN_EXPLORATION_MULTI_PROVIDER_LLM.md` — multi-provider LLM design exploration (not scheduled; Phases A–F outlined)

**Next phases** (per design doc build order):
- Phase C — Curriculum Catalog (`GET /curricula/catalog`, assign catalog package to classroom)
- Phase D — Curriculum Builder (form-based Definition, school admin approval queue)
- Phase E — Pipeline Billing (live cost estimate, Stripe pay-per-run, pipeline trigger gate)

### Phase A — Local Auth polish: layout gate, logout, registration, token refresh (2026-04-12)

**Branch:** `fix/test-isolation-and-prod-bugs`  
**GitHub issues:** #146 (logout), #147 (registration form), #148 (refresh token)  
**Commits:** `0c9546b`, `0d7e487`

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `web/app/(school)/layout.tsx` | Reads `sb_local_teacher_session` cookie; renders `LocalAuthGuard` for local-auth users instead of Auth0 redirect |
| `web/components/school/LocalAuthGuard.tsx` | New "use client" gate: decodes `sb_teacher_token`, checks expiry + `first_login`, renders null during check to prevent flash, then renders full portal layout |
| `backend/src/auth/schemas.py` | Added `ChangePasswordResponse` |
| `backend/src/auth/router.py` | `PATCH /auth/change-password` now returns a fresh JWT with `first_login=False` — no second login needed after password reset |
| `web/lib/api/auth.ts` | Updated `changePassword` return type; added `registerSchool()` + `RegisterSchoolRequest/Response` interfaces |
| `web/app/(public)/school/change-password/page.tsx` | Stores new token + refresh_token from `PATCH /auth/change-password` response |
| `web/app/(public)/school/login/page.tsx` | Sets `sb_local_teacher_session` cookie + stores refresh_token; "Register your school" link added |
| `web/app/(public)/school/register/page.tsx` | New public self-registration page (school name, country, email, password); calls `registerSchool()`; stores token + session cookie on success |
| `web/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` | Clears all three session cookies; detects local-auth and redirects to `/school/login` instead of `/` |
| `web/components/layout/SchoolNav.tsx` | `handleLogout` also removes `sb_teacher_refresh_token` |
| `web/lib/api/school-client.ts` | Added 401 refresh interceptor: one silent `POST /auth/refresh`; concurrent calls coalesced; clears tokens + cookie and redirects on failure |
| `web/lib/dev-session.ts` | Added `getLocalTeacherSession()` reading `sb_local_teacher_session` cookie |

---

### Phase A — Local Auth for School-Provisioned Users (2026-04-12)

**Branch:** `fix/test-isolation-and-prod-bugs`  
**GitHub issues:** #140 (login page), #141 (change-password page), #142 (teacher provision UI), #143 (student provision UI), #144 (seed script), #145 (CLAUDE.md + CHANGES.md)  
**Tests:** 678 backend tests passing

#### Design decision — Third auth track for school-provisioned users

The platform now supports three independent authentication tracks:

| Track | Users | Login endpoint | JWT secret | Token key |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Auth0 exchange | Self-registered students & teachers | `POST /auth/exchange`, `POST /auth/teacher/exchange` | `JWT_SECRET` | `sb_token` / `sb_teacher_token` |
| **Local (Phase A)** | **School founders, provisioned teachers & students** | **`POST /auth/login`** | **`JWT_SECRET`** | **`sb_teacher_token` (teachers/admins), `sb_token` (students)** |
| Admin bcrypt | Internal team | `POST /admin/auth/login` | `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` | `sb_admin_token` |

Local-auth users are created by school admins via API or the seed script. They receive a system-generated password by email and must change it on first login (`first_login=TRUE` in the JWT). The school layout enforces this redirect before any portal navigation.

#### Backend — migration and auth endpoints (shipped in previous commit)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/alembic/versions/0037_phase_a_local_auth.py` | Adds `password_hash TEXT` + `first_login BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` to `teachers` and `students` |
| `backend/src/auth/router.py` | `POST /auth/login` — email+password; `PATCH /auth/change-password` — clears `first_login`; `POST /schools/{id}/teachers` — provision teacher; `POST /schools/{id}/students` — provision student; `POST /schools/{id}/teachers/{id}/reset-password`; `POST /schools/{id}/students/{id}/reset-password`; `POST /schools/{id}/teachers/{id}/promote` |
| `backend/src/auth/service.py` | `login_local_user` — bcrypt verify; timing-safe sentinel hash; RLS bypass via `set_config('app.current_school_id', 'bypass', false)` before pool query |
| `backend/src/auth/schemas.py` | `LocalLoginRequest`, `LocalLoginResponse`, `ChangePasswordRequest`, `ProvisionTeacherRequest/Response`, `ProvisionStudentRequest/Response`, `ResetPasswordResponse`, `PromoteTeacherResponse` |
| `backend/tests/test_phase_a_provisioning.py` | 20 new tests covering all Phase A flows |

**Two production bugs fixed:**
1. **Invalid bcrypt salt** — sentinel hash was a 34-char string; replaced with `bcrypt.hashpw(b"__sentinel__", bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=4)).decode()` at module level.
2. **RLS hiding all rows on login** — `login_local_user` used bare `pool.fetchrow()` without stamping `app.current_school_id='bypass'`; changed to acquire a pool connection explicitly and execute `set_config` before querying.

#### Web — login and change-password pages

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `web/app/(public)/school/login/page.tsx` | Replaced static Auth0 redirect button with email+password form; calls `localLogin()`; stores to correct localStorage key per role; redirects to `/school/change-password?required=1` when `first_login=true` |
| `web/app/(public)/school/change-password/page.tsx` | New page — current password + new password (≥12 chars) + confirm; calls `changePassword()`; amber "required" banner when `?required=1`; SSR-safe (token read in `useEffect`) |
| `web/lib/api/auth.ts` | Added `publicApi` (unauthenticated Axios); `localLogin()`, `changePassword()` functions; `LocalLoginRequest/Response`, `ChangePasswordRequest` interfaces |
| `web/lib/hooks/useTeacher.ts` | Added `first_login: boolean` to `TeacherClaims` interface; decoded from JWT payload in `readTeacherClaims()` |

#### Web — school portal teacher and student management

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `web/lib/api/school-admin.ts` | Added `provisionTeacher()`, `provisionStudent()`, `resetTeacherPassword()`, `resetStudentPassword()`, `promoteTeacher()` functions with full TypeScript interfaces |
| `web/app/(school)/school/teachers/page.tsx` | Replaced `inviteTeacher` (Auth0 link) with `provisionTeacher` form; added Reset Password (KeyRound icon) + Promote to Admin (Crown icon) action buttons on each `TeacherRow` with inline confirmation dialogs |
| `web/app/(school)/school/students/page.tsx` | Added `provisionStudent` "Add a student" form (name, email, grade picker) and `RosterRow` component with Reset Password action for active provisioned students |

#### Dev tooling

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/scripts/seed_phase_a_dev.py` | New idempotent seed script — creates Dev School + Dev Admin + Dev Teacher + Dev Student with local auth; prints credentials to stdout; `--reset` flag drops and recreates all dev data |

**Dev credentials (after running `seed_phase_a_dev.py`):**

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| School admin | `admin@devschool.local` | `DevAdmin1234!` |
| Teacher | `teacher@devschool.local` | `DevTeacher1234!` |
| Student | `student@devschool.local` | `DevStudent1234!` |

#### Documentation

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Auth section updated from "Two-track" to "Three-track"; full Phase A flow; JWT payload examples; added pitfalls #23 (RLS bypass on login) and #24 (`first_login` enforcement at layout level) |

---

### ADR-001 + Demo Teacher Flow + Content Review Improvements (2026-04-05)

**Branch:** `feat/demo-teacher-flow`  
**Tag:** `adr-001-complete`  
**Tests:** 215 backend tests passing

#### ADR-001 — School-as-Primary-Entity Architecture

Three decisions shipped together under `security(adr-001)`:

**Decision 1 — Student-teacher assignment model (migration 0024)**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/alembic/versions/0024_student_teacher_assignments.py` | New `student_teacher_assignments` table; adds `grade` + `teacher_id` columns to `school_enrolments` |
| `backend/src/school/router.py` | `PUT /schools/{id}/students/{student_id}/assignment` — per-student grade + teacher assignment; bulk reassign endpoint |
| `backend/src/school/service.py` | Grade self-change guard: returns 403 on `PATCH /student/profile` if student has `school_id` |
| `backend/tests/test_school_roster.py` | Migrated roster tests to `{students: [...]}` format (old `{student_emails: [...]}` removed in 0024) |

**Decision 2 — School-only billing (migrations 0025–0027)**

| Migration | Description |
|---|---|
| 0025 | Schema corrections: `schools.contact_email UNIQUE` + `teachers.school_id CHECK` |
| 0026 | Drop `private_teachers`, `teacher_subscriptions`, `student_teacher_access`; tighten `curricula.owner_type` CHECK |
| 0027 | Drop `subscriptions` table; Stripe webhook now school-only |

- `backend/src/school/subscription_service.py` — Full rewrite for school-level billing: `activate_school_subscription`, `cancel_school_subscription_db`, `handle_school_payment_failed`, `_bulk_update_enrolled_student_entitlements`
- `backend/src/private_teacher/` — Module removed entirely (no routes remain)

**Decision 3 — PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (migration 0028)**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/alembic/versions/0028_rls.py` | `ENABLE/FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + `tenant_isolation` policy on 7 tables; `app.current_school_id` session variable |
| `backend/src/core/db.py` | `get_db()` stamps `app.current_school_id` from `request.state.rls_school_id` before yielding; resets in `finally` |
| `backend/src/auth/dependencies.py` | `get_current_teacher()` sets `request.state.rls_school_id = payload["school_id"]` |
| `backend/tests/conftest.py` | `db_conn` fixture sets `app.current_school_id = 'bypass'` (transaction-local) |
| `backend/tests/test_rls.py` | 6 new isolation tests using deterministic school UUIDs `a0000000-...001` / `b0000000-...001` |

**Redis key namespace (centralised in `cache_keys.py`)**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/src/core/cache_keys.py` | New module: `ent_key`, `cur_key`, `school_ent_key`, `school_scan_pattern`, `content_key`, `csv_key`, `quiz_set_key` |
| `backend/src/content/service.py` | Switched to `cache_keys` helpers; `get_entitlement()` now queries `school_subscriptions` as source of truth for school-enrolled students (no extra `students` table lookup); `_get_school_sub()` private helper with 300 s Redis cache |
| `backend/src/curriculum/resolver.py` | `invalidate_resolver_cache_for_school()` uses `SCAN school:{school_id}:*` instead of per-student DB lookup |
| `backend/src/auth/tasks.py` | Grade-promotion scan covers `school:*:ent:*`, `school:*:cur:*`, `ent:*`, `cur:*` |

Key prefixes now in use:

| Key | Scope |
|---|---|
| `school:{school_id}:ent:{student_id}` | Entitlement for school-enrolled student |
| `school:{school_id}:cur:{student_id}` | Curriculum resolver for school-enrolled student |
| `school:{school_id}:ent` | Whole-school entitlement summary (TTL 300 s) |
| `ent:{student_id}` | Solo student entitlement (legacy path) |
| `cur:{student_id}` | Solo student curriculum resolver (legacy path) |

---

#### Demo Teacher Flow

**Scope:** Allow a prospective teacher to request a demo account, receive credentials by email, and explore the full school portal with read-only data from MilfordWaterford.

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/alembic/versions/0012_demo_teacher_accounts.py` | `demo_teacher_requests` + `demo_teacher_accounts` tables |
| `backend/src/demo/teacher_router.py` | Request / verify / login / logout for demo teachers |
| `backend/src/demo/teacher_service.py` | Business logic; token generation; email dispatch via Celery |
| `backend/scripts/seed_demo_milfordwaterford.py` | Seeds MilfordWaterford school + teachers Sam Houston (Gr 8) + Linda Ronstad (Gr 12) + 4 students; idempotent |
| `web/app/(public)/demo-teacher/page.tsx` | Public demo teacher request page |
| `web/app/(school)/school/...` | Full school portal with grade-filtered curriculum, roster, reports, alerts |
| `web/components/demo/DemoTeacherRequestModal.tsx` | Modal launched from landing page |
| `web/components/demo/DemoTeacherGate.tsx` | Blocks write actions (demo teachers are read-only) |
| `web/app/(admin)/admin/demo-teacher-accounts/page.tsx` | Admin management: approve / reject / extend / revoke demo teacher accounts |

**Demo teacher credentials (MilfordWaterford):**

| Name | Email | Password | Grade |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sam Houston | sam.houston@milfordwaterford.edu | MWTeacher-Sam-2026! | 8 |
| Linda Ronstad | linda.ronstad@milfordwaterford.edu | MWTeacher-Linda-2026! | 12 |

Login at: `http://localhost:3000/school/login`

#### Content Review Improvements

**AlexJS warnings — per-content-type breakdown (Issue #55)**

Previously AlexJS ran once over all content concatenated, the total count was stored but silently dropped by Pydantic (field was missing from `UnitContentMetaResponse`), and no per-type breakdown existed.

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `pipeline/build_unit.py` | `_extract_text_for_alex_by_type()` returns `{content_type: text}`; AlexJS runs once per type; `meta.json` now stores `alex_warnings_by_type: {"lesson": N, ...}` |
| `backend/src/admin/schemas.py` | Added `alex_warnings_count: int = 0` and `alex_warnings_by_type: dict[str, int] = {}` to `UnitContentMetaResponse` (bug fix — fields were missing) |
| `backend/src/admin/service.py` | `get_unit_content_meta()` reads `alex_warnings_by_type` from `meta.json` |
| `web/lib/api/admin.ts` | Added `alex_warnings_by_type?: Record<string, number>` to `UnitContentMeta` |
| `web/app/(admin)/admin/content-review/[version_id]/unit/[unit_id]/page.tsx` | Left-nav items show per-type warning badge (amber <5 warnings, red ≥5) |

**Inline reviewer annotations (Issue #52)**

- `content_annotations` table (migration 0013): stores annotations keyed by `{unit_id}::{content_type}::{section_id}`
- Unit viewer renders per-section `SectionNotes` component — expandable, with add/delete
- Tutorial sections use tab key as section ID; quiz questions use `Q{n}` suffix

**Side-by-side version diff (Issue #53)**

- `GET /admin/content/review/{version_id}/diff?compare_to={version_id}` returns two full versions
- Frontend at `/admin/content-review/{version_id}/diff` renders word-level diff (green = added, red = removed) using `diffWords` from the `diff` package
- Per content type, per field (section heading, question text, step instruction)

**Batch approve (Issue #54)**

- `POST /admin/content/review/batch-approve` with `{curriculum_id, notes}` — approves all pending versions for a curriculum
- Admin detail page shows "Approve All" button when ≥2 pending versions exist

---

#### Admin schemas fixes (pre-existing bugs exposed by import error)

The following schemas were missing from `schemas.py`, causing an `ImportError` that silently blocked the entire test suite:

| Schema | Shape |
|---|---|
| `AssignRequest` / `AssignResponse` | `admin_id: str | None` → `{version_id, assigned_to_admin_id, assigned_to_email, assigned_at}` |
| `BatchApproveRequest` / `BatchApproveResponse` | `{curriculum_id, notes}` → `{approved_count, version_ids}` |
| `AdminUserItem` / `AdminUsersResponse` | `{admin_user_id, email, role}` |
| `SubscriptionAnalyticsResponse` | Updated from individual-billing shape (`active_monthly`, `active_annual`) to school-billing shape (`by_plan`, `total_active`, `mrr_usd: str`) |

---

#### Accessibility + typography (Rules 18 + 13)

- Inter / Merriweather / JetBrains Mono font stack loaded via `@fontsource` — no external CDN
- Dyslexia toggle via Eye icon in portal header or **Alt+D** — persisted in `sb_dyslexic` cookie
- `/healthz` liveness + `/readyz` readiness probes added (Rule 13)

---

#### Pipeline improvements

| Change | Detail |
|---|---|
| `max_tokens=8192` | Always set in `_call_claude()` — Grade 12 tutorials exceeded 4096 and produced truncated JSON |
| `subject_name` column | Added to `content_subject_versions` (migration 0015); pipeline stores human-readable subject name alongside `subject` key |
| `payload_bytes` tracking | Migration 0014; pipeline records output byte count per job |
| Per-unit AlexJS | `_extract_text_for_alex_by_type()` introduced; each content type checked independently |

---

**How to test:**

```bash
# Start all services
./dev_start.sh

# Seed MilfordWaterford demo school (teachers + students)
docker compose exec api python scripts/seed_demo_milfordwaterford.py

# Run backend tests
docker compose exec api python -m pytest -q

# Teacher login
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/demo/teacher/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"sam.houston@milfordwaterford.edu","password":"MWTeacher-Sam-2026!"}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

- `web/app/(public)/page.tsx` — Replaced static CTA with `<DemoRequestModal />`
- `web/app/(student)/layout.tsx` — Added `<DemoBanner />` above `<TrialBanner />`
- `web/app/(student)/account/settings/page.tsx` — Wrapped with `<DemoGate>` (demo users cannot edit settings)
- `web/app/(student)/account/subscription/page.tsx` — Wrapped with `<DemoGate>` (demo users cannot manage subscription)
- `web/app/(admin)/admin/feedback/page.tsx` — Minor layout tweak (carried in this branch)
- `web/components/layout/AdminNav.tsx` — Added "Demo Accounts" nav item (minRole: `product_admin`)
- `web/i18n/en.json` — Added `demo.*` translation namespace
- `web/lib/api/admin.ts` — Added `getDemoAccounts`, `extendDemoAccount`, `revokeDemoAccount`, `adminResendDemoVerification`, `DemoAccountItem`, `DemoAccountListResponse` types
- `web/package.json` / `web/package-lock.json` — Added `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers`, `zod` dependencies
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — Enabled pipeline tests (no longer skipped)

**Key decisions made:**

- Demo JWT uses role `demo_student` — routed through the same student auth dependency but distinguished by role to allow gating
- `useDemoStudent()` reads from `localStorage` (key `sb_token`) and decodes the JWT client-side; no extra API call needed
- `DemoGate` renders a placeholder for blocked routes rather than redirecting, keeping the URL intact for user orientation
- `DemoBanner` uses `role="status"` + `aria-label` for screen-reader announcement; urgent state (< 2 hours) switches to red palette and prepends "Urgent:" label
- Admin demo-accounts page guards behind `hasPermission(role, "product_admin")` — `developer` and `tester` see "Access denied"
- Seed script connects to raw PostgreSQL (not PgBouncer) to avoid asyncpg prepared-statement issues in transaction-pooling mode
- Email service uses Gmail SMTP via `aiosmtplib`; template rendering via Jinja2 to keep HTML out of Python strings

**New backend endpoints added:**

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/demo/request` | Public | Submit email to request a 24-hour demo |
| GET | `/api/v1/demo/verify/{token}` | Public | Verify email token, create demo account, send credentials |
| POST | `/api/v1/demo/verify/resend` | Public | Resend verification email for pending request |
| POST | `/api/v1/demo/auth/login` | Public | Authenticate with demo credentials, return JWT |
| POST | `/api/v1/demo/auth/logout` | Demo JWT | Blacklist JTI in Redis |
| GET | `/api/v1/admin/demo-accounts` | Admin JWT (product_admin+) | List demo requests with filter/search/pagination |
| POST | `/api/v1/admin/demo-accounts/{id}/extend` | Admin JWT (product_admin+) | Extend demo expiry by N hours |
| POST | `/api/v1/admin/demo-accounts/{id}/revoke` | Admin JWT (product_admin+) | Immediately revoke demo access |
| POST | `/api/v1/admin/demo-accounts/{request_id}/resend` | Admin JWT (product_admin+) | Admin-triggered resend of verification email |

**How to run:**

```bash
# Start all services
./dev_start.sh

# Seed the persistent demo test account (inside api container)
docker compose exec api python scripts/seed_demo_test_account.py
# Or with custom TTL:
docker compose exec api python scripts/seed_demo_test_account.py --ttl-days 7
# Dry-run to preview:
docker compose exec api python scripts/seed_demo_test_account.py --dry-run
```

**How to test:**

```bash
# Web unit tests (839 passing)
cd web && npm test

# Backend demo tests (requires running DB)
./dev_start.sh test
# Or targeted:
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_demo_infra.py backend/tests/test_demo_endpoints.py backend/tests/test_admin_demo_accounts.py -v

# Manual demo flow:
# 1. Visit http://localhost:3000 → click "Try a free demo"
# 2. Enter email → receive verification email
# 3. Click link → land on /demo/verify/[token] → credentials displayed
# 4. Visit /demo/login → log in → student portal with DemoBanner
# 5. Try /account/settings or /account/subscription → see DemoGate
# 6. Admin: /admin/demo-accounts → list/extend/revoke/resend
```
